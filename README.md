## About the Video Course
This course is your guide to performing real-time data analytics and stream processing with Spark. Use different components and tools such as HDFS, HBase, and Hive to process raw data. Learn how tools such as Hive and Pig aid in this process.

In this course, you will start off by learning data analysis techniques with Hadoop using tools such as Hive. Furthermore, you will learn to apply these techniques in real-world big data applications. Also, you will delve into Spark and its related tools to perform real-time data analytics, streaming, and batch processing on your application.

Finally, you'll learn how to extend your analytics solutions to the cloud.
